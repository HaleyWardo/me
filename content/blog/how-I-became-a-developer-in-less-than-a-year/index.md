On September 26, 2018, I gave a lightening talk on how I became a developer in less than a year. I thought it would be a great way to share my experience for those who are interested in maybe changing careers and don't know where to start. I also thought it would be a motivation for those who are having imposter syndrome, as I suffered from it myself and shared my experiences in this talk. 

**Here you can find the YouTube video of my lightening talk:**
